**Khobor AI** is a revolutionary AI-driven news aggregator designed specifically for the busy Bangladeshi context. It solves the "information overload" problem by scraping trusted sources, summarizing key insights using Gemini AI, and converting them into a high-quality audio playlist for hands-free consumption.

Whether you are walking to your office, stuck in Dhaka's legendary traffic, or preparing for your day—**Khobor AI** ensures you are always informed, without ever needing to look at a screen.

## 🌟 The Vision: "Listen, Don't Just Read"
In Bangladesh, missing a sudden holiday notice or a road-block update can ruin your entire day. Traditional news apps are cluttered with noise and bias. **Khobor AI** acts as your personal "AI Editor-in-Chief," filtering out the noise and prioritizing utility news (Traffic, Holidays, National Alerts) over everything else.

### 🎯 Key Problems We Solve:
1. **Safety First:** Reading news while walking is dangerous. We provide a **Podcast-style briefing**.
2. **Time Saver:** We summarize long articles into 1-minute audio clips.
3. **Hyper-Local Utility:** Real-time updates on traffic, strikes, and government notices.
4. **Information Lifecycle:** We automatically distinguish between "Just-in" updates (Traffic) and "Permanent" news (Policy changes).
